# instagram_app
Instagram Database app that will replicate a large amount of data and the tables that contain it.

# Use & general information
These MySQL files are on my GH to simply display my knowledge, projects and examples of work. In order to actually execute this file and the commands:

Go to a server hosting site with a command line terminal, such as ide.goorm.io, which is what I used to create and execute my databases, tables, and commands.

Copy and paste my examples and feel free to modify the data and mess with commands yourself. If you have any questions, reach out via LinkedIn!
